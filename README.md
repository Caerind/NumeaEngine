# NumeaEngine

My first 3D engine. Mainly for learning purposes  

-------------------------------------
  
#### Why another engine ?   
  
I made several engines yet and I didn't want to make new ones but my level in engine design and architecture has quite improved since the last one.  
But this is already the reason I had for each engine I made.  
Now, I want to make a clear separation between my 2D stuff using SFML and what I'm going to do now.

#### What the engine will do ?  
  
As I'm learning OpenGL now, the first objectives will be really simple :  
- System engine features  
- Math engine features  
- Basic 3D engine features  

The engine is thought to be for Windows, and others platforms doesn't have the focus yet.
